/**
 * Class ZombieSpawner
 *
 * Spawn: In the Overworld, zombies spawn in groups of 4 at a light level of 7 or less. In desert biomes, all zombies
 * exposed to the sky will have an 80% chance to be replaced by husks, a zombie variant. Zombies that are not husks
 * have a 5% chance to spawn as a zombie villager while all zombie variants also have a 5% chance to spawn as a baby
 * zombie type. Baby zombies have an additional 5% chance of spawning as a chicken jockey.
 *
 * Light level of 7 or less and 1Ã—2 space anywhere but transparent blocks (half blocks, glass, TNT etc).
